### Market Needs:
-   Need a more visual way of seeing products being sold, epsecially used products
-   People want to buy competitively, be able to see how much others have paid for similar used products
-   kind of like `craigslist` with `stockx` with `google maps api`
-   Why Exotic Cars Specifically
    -   cars, particularly used cars, are one of those commodities where prices can fluctuate vastly based on the car. Having knowledge on past sold cars could be very beneficial to an intereseted buyer and could potentially help them save tens of thousands of dollars

    -   create a visual way of mapping exotic cars
    -   Give historical data on how much these used items have been sold for in the past
