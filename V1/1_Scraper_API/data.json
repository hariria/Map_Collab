Winning bidder must communicate with Seller by phone within 24 hours of the end of auction to make arrangements to complete transaction.

As-Is: The Last Detail has described the above-mentioned vehicle to the best of our ability, however, as with all pre-owned automobiles, the condition is subjective, and recommend that the buyer inspect and test drive the vehicle before finalizing their purchase. The Last Detail shall and will make every reasonable effort to disclose any known defects associated with the vehicle at the buyer&rsquo;s request prior to close of sale. No allowances or set aside will be made on account of any incorrectness, imperfection, defect or damage.

It is the sole responsibility of the buyer to verify the existence of options, accessories and the vehicle condition before time of sale. Any and all differences must be addressed prior to the time of sale. The Last Detail assumes no responsibility for any repairs regardless of any oral statements about the vehicle. Despite our best efforts to verify a vehicle&rsquo;s mechanical condition, we are not able to warranty a manufacturer&rsquo;s workmanship or a previous owner&rsquo;s diligence in care of said vehicle. There are no mechanical guarantees, expressed or implied. We will not be responsible for buyer&rsquo;s remorse or issues to said vehicle once it has left our premises. We are being realistic; most of the cars we sell are vintage and by their very nature will need TLC and some degree of attention sooner or later. Therefore, all vehicles are sold &ldquo;AS IS&rdquo;. However, extended warranty options are available on most vehicles. Please inquire if you are interested. Mileage: Vintage cars in excess of 10 years of age, in most US states, mileage may be recorded as &ldquo;exempt&rdquo;. The Last Detail makes no warranties as to the accuracy of the mileage indicated or shown and accepts no responsibility for any discrepancy with independent reports such as CarFax, Autocheck, etc. Unless the vehicle is advertised as an original mileage car, do not assume that the mileage/odometer reading is the actual mileage.
