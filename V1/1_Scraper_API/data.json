Winning bidder must communicate with Seller by phone within 24 hours of the end of auction to make arrangements to complete transaction.

As-Is: The Last Detail has described the above-mentioned vehicle to the best of our ability, however, as with all pre-owned automobiles, the condition is subjective, and recommend that the buyer inspect and test drive the vehicle before finalizing their purchase. The Last Detail shall and will make every reasonable effort to disclose any known defects associated with the vehicle at the buyer&rsquo;s request prior to close of sale. No allowances or set aside will be made on account of any incorrectness, imperfection, defect or damage.

It is the sole responsibility of the buyer to verify the existence of options, accessories and the vehicle condition before time of sale. Any and all differences must be addressed prior to the time of sale. The Last Detail assumes no responsibility for any repairs regardless of any oral statements about the vehicle. Despite our best efforts to verify a vehicle&rsquo;s mechanical condition, we are not able to warranty a manufacturer&rsquo;s workmanship or a previous owner&rsquo;s diligence in care of said vehicle. There are no mechanical guarantees, expressed or implied. We will not be responsible for buyer&rsquo;s remorse or issues to said vehicle once it has left our premises. We are being realistic; most of the cars we sell are vintage and by their very nature will need TLC and some degree of attention sooner or later. Therefore, all vehicles are sold &ldquo;AS IS&rdquo;. However, extended warranty options are available on most vehicles. Please inquire if you are interested. Mileage: Vintage cars in excess of 10 years of age, in most US states, mileage may be recorded as &ldquo;exempt&rdquo;. The Last Detail makes no warranties as to the accuracy of the mileage indicated or shown and accepts no responsibility for any discrepancy with independent reports such as CarFax, Autocheck, etc. Unless the vehicle is advertised as an original mileage car, do not assume that the mileage/odometer reading is the actual mileage.

Payment must be in US dollars only. Please be sure to have full payment and/or approved financing in place before making your final bid on eBay auction vehicles. Due to the difficulty of foreign currency/bank transactions, purchases from clients outside of the United States, must pay by wire transfer only. NO EXCEPTIONS. Please call us with any questions. Deposit The winning bidder is required to submit a $2,000 deposit which is due immediately following the close of the auction. This $2,000 deposit is good towards the purchase of the vehicle and will be deducted from the total amount of the purchase (unless otherwise requested). We accept credit cards (Visa, MasterCard, Discover, AMEX), PAYPAL and/or personal checks for the initial deposit only. Our maximum deposit/partial payment by credit card is $2000. If the vehicle cannot be picked up or paid for completely within 7-days from the close of auction, a $2,000 NON-REFUNDABLE deposit is required to extend our hold period to 14 days, unless other arrangements are made beforehand (just keep us informed, were human, we recognize unforeseeable events). All deposits and fees collected are NON-REFUNDABLE in the event the vehicle is not paid for. Contact us for details. Balance of Payment Due The buyer agrees to pay remaining balance due (plus ALL applicable fees and taxes) within 7 days of the close of the auction. All financial transactions must be completed before delivery of the vehicle and the vehicle needs to be paid for in full. If the car is not paid for (or other arrangements are not made), we reserve the right to resell the vehicle seven days after the close of the eBay auction or receipt of deposit. Additional fees and taxes Applicable fees are: (1) EVERY out-of-state transaction requires an additional $20.00 seven-day New York drive-away permit fee and a $195.00 New York Documentary Fee plus State Sales tax if applicable Out of state buyers are responsible for ALL state, county, city taxes and fees, as well as title/registration fees in the state that the vehicle will be registered. We will provide you with proper sales tax documentation showing proof of the taxes we collect for you. Vehicle Titles In nearly every case, most vehicle titles are on hand and ready for delivery. Some vehicle need to be retitled to the dealer in New York, and some titles may be held by banks or lenders as collateral for loans in process of pay off. In these cases, there may be a short delay in receiving the title and/or documents which can take 10 to 21 days from the time we pay the vehicle off. While these instances are rare, LuxSport Motor Group, LLC guarantees that all vehicle titles are free and clear with no liens or liabilities on them. While we normally have all titles in our possession at the time of delivery, there are rare occasions where we may be waiting for them to arrive. If payment is made via wire transfer or cashiers check, we will hold the title until ALL funds have cleared (typically 5-10 business days). Please call if you have any questions regarding our titling policy. ATTN International and Canadian Buyers: we can assist you by faxing proper sales and title documentation to the U.S. border crossing or shipping port of choice for you.

The Ferrari 488 GTB was introduced in 2015 to replace the previous 458 Italia. The 488 GTB was named \"The Supercar of the Year 2015\" by car magazine Top Gear, as well as becoming Motor Trend's 2017 \"Best Driver's Car\". Powered by a 3.9 Liter all-aluminum dry sump unit Turbocharged with two parallel ball-bearing twin-scroll turbochargers with air-to-air intercoolers and compressor wheels made of low-density TiAl alloy often used in jet engines to reduce inertia and resist high temperatures within the turbocharger. The engine produces 661 HP and 561 lbft of torque allowing a 0-60MPH sprint in a neck snapping 2.7 Seconds. To further enhance the body lines of this amazing machine, this 488 GTB has been outfitted with a Misha Design Carbon Fiber Body Kit. The Front Diffuser, Hood, Wide Body Fenders, Side Skirts, Rear Deck, Spoiler and Rear Diffuser are made entirely out of Carbon Fiber. The exposed matte Carbon adds an amzing contrast against the Ferrari Rosso Corsa making this 488 a real head turner. Tastefully lowered (original springs included as well) onto Savini SV-F2 Wheels with brand new Michilin Pilot Tires, this 488 has the perfect stance. With just over 800 miles, this 488 GTB is an incredible value and a true Italian Masterpiece. Great lease rates and Financing also available on any of our inventory!
