Terms: Bidders with less than 5 feedbacks must contact us prior to bidding. If you do not contact us, we reserve the right to cancel your bid without notice. Please do not ask our reserve price, simply bid what you are comfortable with. Your winning bid is a contract to purchase the vehicle, not a \"come, look, and negotiate.\" This is a serious auction for serious buyers only. Please ask all relevant questions prior to bidding. All vehicles are sold as-is. By placing a bid, you are agreeing to these terms of sale. Winning bidder must communicate with Seller by phone within 24 hours of the end of auction to make arrangements to complete transaction. If no contact is made, we reserve the right to re-list the vehicle, sell it to the next highest bidder, or sell it otherwise. If you are not comfortable with this, DO NOT BID! As-Is: The Last Detail has described the above-mentioned vehicle to the best of our ability, however, as with all pre-owned automobiles, the condition is subjective, and recommend that the buyer inspect and test drive the vehicle before finalizing their purchase. The Last Detail shall and will make every reasonable effort to disclose any known defects associated with the vehicle at the buyer&rsquo;s request prior to close of sale. No allowances or set aside will be made on account of any incorrectness, imperfection, defect or damage. Any descriptions or representations are for identification purposes only and are not to be construed as a warranty of any type. It is the responsibility of the buyer to have thoroughly inspected the vehicle, and to have satisfied himself or herself as to the condition and value and to bid based upon that judgement solely. It is the sole responsibility of the buyer to verify the existence of options, accessories and the vehicle condition before time of sale. Any and all differences must be addressed prior to the time of sale. The Last Detail assumes no responsibility for any repairs regardless of any oral statements about the vehicle. Despite our best efforts to verify a vehicle&rsquo;s mechanical condition, we are not able to warranty a manufacturer&rsquo;s workmanship or a previous owner&rsquo;s diligence in care of said vehicle. There are no mechanical guarantees, expressed or implied. We will not be responsible for buyer&rsquo;s remorse or issues to said vehicle once it has left our premises. We are being realistic; most of the cars we sell are vintage and by their very nature will need TLC and some degree of attention sooner or later. Therefore, all vehicles are sold &ldquo;AS IS&rdquo;. However, extended warranty options are available on most vehicles. Please inquire if you are interested. Mileage: Vintage cars in excess of 10 years of age, in most US states, mileage may be recorded as &ldquo;exempt&rdquo;. The Last Detail makes no warranties as to the accuracy of the mileage indicated or shown and accepts no responsibility for any discrepancy with independent reports such as CarFax, Autocheck, etc. Unless the vehicle is advertised as an original mileage car, do not assume that the mileage/odometer reading is the actual mileage. It is simply what the odometer is reading at the time pictures are taken. MILEAGE IS NOT ACTUAL UNLESS STATED SO IN THE DESCRIPTION! Vehicles are test driven and mileage may vary at time of sale.

The Ferrari 488 GTB was introduced in 2015 to replace the previous 458 Italia. The 488 GTB was named \"The Supercar of the Year 2015\" by car magazine Top Gear, as well as becoming Motor Trend's 2017 \"Best Driver's Car\". Powered by a 3.9 Liter all-aluminum dry sump unit Turbocharged with two parallel ball-bearing twin-scroll turbochargers with air-to-air intercoolers and compressor wheels made of low-density TiAl alloy often used in jet engines to reduce inertia and resist high temperatures within the turbocharger. The engine produces 661 HP and 561 lbft of torque allowing a 0-60MPH sprint in a neck snapping 2.7 Seconds. To further enhance the body lines of this amazing machine, this 488 GTB has been outfitted with a Misha Design Carbon Fiber Body Kit. The Front Diffuser, Hood, Wide Body Fenders, Side Skirts, Rear Deck, Spoiler and Rear Diffuser are made entirely out of Carbon Fiber. The exposed matte Carbon adds an amzing contrast against the Ferrari Rosso Corsa making this 488 a real head turner. Tastefully lowered (original springs included as well) onto Savini SV-F2 Wheels with brand new Michilin Pilot Tires, this 488 has the perfect stance. With just over 800 miles, this 488 GTB is an incredible value and a true Italian Masterpiece. Great lease rates and Financing also available on any of our inventory!

Miracle Autosport is pleased to offer you this rare 2001 Ferrari 550 Maranello investment opportunity . This car is just stunning. If you are looking at this ad then you already know the facts and specs on this car so I won't bore you with the incredible performance stats, the unbeatable driving pleasure it brings, or the rarity of the car itself. This particular one was purchased by a friend of mine about 2 years ago. Prior to his purchase there was a major service done including belts and most gaskets. He also, at that time, had a Capristo exhaust installed (the factory one will come with the car). Prior to his purchase he also requested all of the sticky buttons be addressed. Anyone who owns a Ferrari knows problem is common, annoying, and expensive to address. The car has all of the books, tools, etc., which can be seen in the photos. These cars have appreciated more in the last few years than almost any Ferrari of the modern era. Many experts have predicted these will continue to increase in value significantly in the years to come. This is a rare change to own a car that not only turns heads, but also will almost certainly appreciate. The only reason my friend decided to sell the car is that he had some other investment opportunities arise and his wife asked him to sell one of his Ferraris before pursuing another venture. The car also comes with the factory cover, seat cover, and wheel cover. If you have any questions at all please don't hesitate to call. This is your chance to own a an exotic car that is actually a solid investment. These don't come available often so don't let this one pass you by. This car is not kept on site so please be sure to contact me prior to coming in order to schedule an inspection. I will do my best to make sure you enjoy your experience dealing with us and we will pr ovide the best service from start to finish during your transaction.

MILES, 2-OWN, CLEAN HISTORY, FULL SERVICE, LUGGAGE & TOOL KIT, PRISTINE Stock #: 0026-TPA Exterior Color: Red Interior Color: Black Body Type: Coupe Transmission: 5 Speed Manual Engine: 4.9L F12 Title Condition: Clear Vehicle Description The Ferrari Testarossa was an icon from day one. It looked as aggressive as a V12 Ferrari should, but not all of them were created equal. This one is an ultra-desirable 1986 model with exceptionally low miles, and maintenance history (including a recent full service.) This is also only a 2-owner car, which is extremely rare to see in the exotic car world where cars often change hands frequently. Some cars are called the poster-child for a company, but for...\u00a0an entire generation, the Testarossa was genuinely the poster of choice for every child's room. The wild styling of Testarossa earned this envy because it was how a supercar from Ferrari should look. While the car's redhead name is a reference to the cam covers and a tribute to the legendary 250 TR, it's also really the best color for this iconic prancing horse. Of course we say that because the paintwork on our exceptionally well-preserved classic is the kind of pristine many in our showroom have described as \"flawless.\" This is a sign of special care that you can see in every picture of this thoroughly original Ferrari. While all Testarossas came with the same angular and aggressive styling that ran from the long flat nose right through the seductively wide rear end, this one was the final year for the now-collectable \"flying mirror\". The high mounted single driver mirror is a piece of brazen automotive asymmetry that could only be pulled off with this car's Italian flair. The Testarossa represented the upper echelon of society, and so of course, the interior delivered a level of refinement worthy of its price tag. The Nero leather seats still look amazing, especially with the prancing horse embossed in the headrest. They are grippy enough for a supercar, but Ferrari made sure that the Testarossa had a grand touring level of comfort. That's also why these cars came with comfort features like air conditioning, power seats, power steering, power windows, tilt steering wheel, and an AM/FM/cassette stereo neatly tucked away under a cover on the dashboard. All of this was standard equipment straight from Maranello. In fact, there was only one option for the Testarossa. This coupe's six-piece Schedoni custom luggage set that fits behind the seats and trunk has the kind of rarity that starts bidding wars all on its own. The mid-mounted 4.9-liter boxer V12 was the culmination of this motor at Ferrari. The 380 hp fuel-injected engine was a 14% increase in power over the last Berlinetta Boxer predecessor, and the Testarossa had 0 to 60 mph times could compete with its cross-Italy rival, the Lamborghini Countach. But since this has matured into a classic that's welcomed at any concours, there is a new set of rules in Testarossa shopping. This is a fully numbers-matching car with exceptionally low miles at 14,277. The CarFax on this car is 100% clean and reports no issues. When a car has averaged less than 500 miles per year, the next step is to look at its maintenance records. You'll see that this Ferrari has not only been preserved, but also maintained. This includes a recent full service (all belts, fluids, and clutch master cylinder) from the Ferrari technicians at Reeves Motorcars. It even has its correct single bolt wheels with Michelin TRX tires (concours judges look for that.) But as much as this one is ready to be an award-winner, we'll bet you won't be able to resist grabbing the leather three-spoke steering wheel with one hand and the iconic gated five-speed shifter with the other and really opening this one up on the backroads. After all, a Ferrari is a thing of beauty, but no one really falls in love until you hear that racecar exhaust note. This car comes with everything original from the manuals to the ultra-rare tool kit that's never been used. This Ferrari is the one time you can meet your hero, and it won't disappoint.

However, most vehicles may still be in factory warranty or an extended warranty may be purchased. Ask for details.

If the payment is not a bank wire transfer, i.e., certified bank check or approved loan check, the title will only be released when all funds have cleared. Please keep in mind that the funds verification process can take up to 15 days. We will assist buyers with whatever documents you will need to clear Canadian customs, but knowing exactly which documents are required by your home province are the buyers responsibility.

If it is as good as your auction description and there are no surprises you will have another successful auction and extremely good feedback from me. By the way, I checked with many of your eBay customers and every one was happy with their purchase from you.

A Thank You E Mail from an Actual Customer My car arrived as described. The only thing missing was the CD Changer magazine. Leslie, told me to purchase one and send in the receipt. I have purchased one, but I am going to absorb the cost myself. It was a small expense and you folks have been very flexible with me. I really like the car. It rides and drives very nice.Overall, it is a very nice automobile. I would not have any second thoughts about purchasing from you again. I appreciate doing business with you and hopefully we can do business again in the future. I will also try to send you some business, although some people thought I was nuts for making such a large purchase sight unseen. Then when they saw the car, they changed their minds.Good Luck with your business.Sincerely, D. Evans -Tennessee A Thank You E Mail from an Actual Customer The car I received is great and this combined with your willingness to go the \"extra mile\" to have me as a happy customer is just great! My mother is going to buy a car in the next month or so. She was understandably afraid to buy a car over the internet. However, after I shared my experience with her, she became more comfortable with this idea and asked me to help her out. I like the service from you and will not go anywhere to buy a car except buying it at EXPO MOTORCARS. Hence, I will be a client of yours again and I hope many more times. Keep up the great job and feel free to share my comments with your coworkers and customers! I will also be willing to take phone calls from your prospective buyers and talk to them about the great experience I had with your dealership. Thank you, Stan S. - California A Thank You E Mail from an Actual Customer Scott, I would like to thank both you, and Leslie for the pleasant and professional experience of buying an automobile from you and EXPO MOTORCARS.

The Ferrari Testarossa (Type F110) is a 12-cylinder mid-engine car that was designed to replace the outgoing 512 BBI. The Testarossa name paid homage to the famed World Sportscar Champion 1957 Ferrari 250 Testa Rossa sports racing car. Testa Rossa, which literally means \"red head\" in Italian, refers to the red-painted cam covers sported by both cars' 12-cylinder engines. Pininfarina's body was a departure from the curvaceous 512 BBI and created some initial controversy. The side strakes that spanned from the doors to the rear fenders were needed for rules in several countries outlawing large openings on cars. The Testarossa had twin radiators in the back with the engine instead of a single radiator up-front. In conjunction the strakes provided cool air to the rear-mounted side radiators, thus keeping the engine from overheating. The strakes also made the Testarossa wider at the rear than in the front, thus increasing stability and handling while eventually becoming one of the most famous design elements. Like its predecessor, the Testarossa used double wishbone front and rear suspension systems. Ferrari improved traction by adding 10-inch-wide alloy rear wheels. The Testarossa drivetrain was also an evolution of the BB 512i. Its engine used near identical displacement and compression ratio, but unlike the BB 512i had four-valve cylinder heads that were finished in red. The Testarossa sports a 4.9-litre flat-12 engine with each cylinder having four valves and compression of 9.2 to Lubrication is via a dry sump system. This resulted in 390 HP and 361 ft-lb of Torque allowing the Testarossa to post a 0-60 MPH time of 5.2 Seconds and a top speed of just of 180 MPH. Testarossas are rising in value and are becoming sought after additions to collectors. This amazing example is a 3 owner California car that is absolutely stunning. Complete with RARE FACTORY LUGGAGE SET, Factory Tool Kit, Factory Car Cover, Books and Dealer Brochures. The car has been meticulously cared for and it shows from the shine of the paint to the amazingly well kept interior, including the driver's seat that shows minimal wear. Finished in Iconic Ross Corsa over Tan, this Red Head will not last long. Great lease rates and Financing also available on any of our inventory! Buy Sell Trade Consignments Welcome!

Get started now \u00bb ABOUT US Hurst Autoplex Mitsubishi is family owned and operated by the Baum family with over 35 years in the automobile industry. Being a franchise dealer we offer an entire range of vehicles at competitive pricing with the pride of a successful transaction that only a family operation can offer. Hurst Autoplex is the Pre-Owned division of Hurst Autoplex Mitsubishi, located in the same location. Our family of dealerships have consistently been one of the top 5 Mitsubishi stores in the nation and #1 in the state of Texas. We are proud to announce that Hurst Autoplex has opened a newly-renovated state of the art facility located on 4 acres directly off NE Loop 820. For your convenience our indoor showroom provides you with the ability to shop comfortably rain or shine. You will find a complete range of vehicles to fit your every need. From a family hauling SUV to a luxurious sedan, we have it all. Some of our customers still ask &ldquo;What is a Mitsubishi dealer doing with this type of car&rdquo;. The owner of our dealership is our buyer and he did not want the dealership limited to a few certain brands. Our inventory consists of trade-ins, lease vehicles, and program cars. He personally hand picks our late model and 'highline' vehicles which are usually one owner with a remaining warranty. Hurst Autoplex promotes a family atmosphere for its employees and our wonderful customers. The dealership claims low employee turnover and dedicated customer service. We have learned to listen to our customers helping us to fulfill your needs. We are competitive without sacrificing quality service, our integrity, or our 100% commitment to you-our most valuable asset.

Designed by Pininfarina, the body styling of the F430 was revised from its predecessor, the Ferrari 360, to improve its aerodynamic efficiency. A great extent of Ferrari heritage was included in the exterior design. At the rear, the Enzo's tail lights and engine cover vents were added. The car's name was etched on the Testarossa-styled driver's side mirror. The large oval openings in the front bumper are reminiscent of Ferrari racing models from the 60s The F430's entirely new Power Plant, a 4.3L V8 was a significant departure for Ferrari, as all previous Ferrari V8's were descendants of the Dino racing program of the 1950s. The engine's output specifications are 483 HP at 8500 rpm and 343 lbft of torque at 5250 RPM. The connecting rods, pistons and crankshaft were all entirely new, while the four-valve cylinder head, valves and intake trumpets were directly retained from Formula 1 engines. The F430 has a top speed in excess of 196 mph and can accelerate from 0 to 60 mph 3.6 seconds, 0.6 seconds quicker than the old model. The F430 featured the E-Diff, a computer-controlled limited slip active differential which can vary the distribution of torque based on inputs such as steering angle and lateral acceleration. Other notable features include the first application of Ferrari's manettino steering wheel-mounted control knob which allows drivers to select from five different settings which modify the vehicle's ESC system, \"Skyhook\" electronic suspension, transmission behavior, throttle response, and E-Diff. This stunning Spyder is finished in Grigio Silverstone with Black interior and Black top. The interior features a tasteful amount of carbon and a yellow Rev Counter. Factory installed Scuderia Shields add to the amazing curb appeal of this Spyder. This F430 has a clean CARFAX and less than 13K Miles on it. A Clear Bra is installed and Tubi exhaust has been added and delivers the amazing sound only generated by a Ferrari. Great lease rates and Financing also available on any of our inventory!

A Thank You E Mail from an Actual Customer My car arrived as described. The only thing missing was the CD Changer magazine. Leslie, told me to purchase one and send in the receipt. I have purchased one, but I am going to absorb the cost myself. It was a small expense and you folks have been very flexible with me. I really like the car. It rides and drives very nice.Overall, it is a very nice automobile. I would not have any second thoughts about purchasing from you again. I appreciate doing business with you and hopefully we can do business again in the future. I will also try to send you some business, although some people thought I was nuts for making such a large purchase sight unseen. Then when they saw the car, they changed their minds.Good Luck with your business.Sincerely, D. Evans -Tennessee A Thank You E Mail from an Actual Customer The car I received is great and this combined with your willingness to go the \"extra mile\" to have me as a happy customer is just great! My mother is going to buy a car in the next month or so. She was understandably afraid to buy a car over the internet. However, after I shared my experience with her, she became more comfortable with this idea and asked me to help her out. I like the service from you and will not go anywhere to buy a car except buying it at EXPO MOTORCARS. Hence, I will be a client of yours again and I hope many more times. Keep up the great job and feel free to share my comments with your coworkers and customers! I will also be willing to take phone calls from your prospective buyers and talk to them about the great experience I had with your dealership. Thank you, Stan S. - California A Thank You E Mail from an Actual Customer Scott, I would like to thank both you, and Leslie for the pleasant and professional experience of buying an automobile from you and EXPO MOTORCARS. The Viper was as advertised. What a beautiful car. My wife thought it was beautiful also. I would recommend that anyone looking for a high end or special automobile should go to your website or call EXPO MOTORCARS. Once again thanks Scott and Leslie for your help in making my buying experience easy and pleasant. Robert A.-Kansas Actual E Mails Exchanged from Actual Customers Q: Hi, I'm about to purchase a car from expo-motors and wanted to make sure you did enjoy your experience. How was shipping? I appreciate it. Thanks, Stan R. A: On a scale of 1 to 10 - 10 is excellent - I give it an 11 ! The car was *exactly* as described & pictured. The car was in excellent condition, The shipping was affordable & painless (they arranged it. $800 to ship via truck). It took 8 days to get from Texas to California. They return emails, they call you back, and will respond to all questions & concerns you may have. Plus the prices are fantastic! I got mine below wholesale! Hard to believe we are \"Mail ordering\" cars now isn't it?? But I would do it again with Expo in a heartbeat! Hope that helps! Harry. A Thank You E Mail from an Actual Customer Leslie, The car is wonderful and so was the customer service. It is hard to believe that we \"Mail Ordered\" a Mercedes-Benz !! We will definitely be buying our next car from you all !!! You can use me as a reference anytime!!!!!!!!

Ferrari has been known for automotive engineering excellence for decades, producing some of the most inspired rides to ever hit the street. This Ferrari F430 is a great example - it's a world class head turner that's in super sharp condition and packs outstanding power under its hood. Unusually lightly travelled over the past decade plus and in top notch condition, it represents the opportunity...\u00a0to own one of the world's most coveted performance cars. Ferrari has always occupied a singular niche among the exotic car manufacturers, combining cutting edge, almost futuristic styling sensibilities with a great sense of refinement. With its Grigio Silvertone exterior still in top notch condition, this F430 has a magnetism that few other cars could even approach, and it's as clean as can be. Take as long and close a look as you'd like - which in this case is likely to be VERY long and VERY close, and you won't find anything to detract from this iconic sports car's celestial curb appeal. It's one of Ferrari's most memorable models, but in reality it was only around for about five years, taking over from the well-respected 360 just a couple of years before this '06 first saw life. While it shares the same approximate chassis with its predecessor, the F430 offered even more extreme road hugging ability, due to the increased downdraft its revised exterior employs to hold the car to the pavement. With only about 15,000 miles under its belt, everything within exterior view presents exceptionally well, down to the pair of Scuderia Ferrari emblems on the front fenders. The Bordeaux red leather interior would be a show-stopper in virtually any condition but owing to the light driver and passenger traffic it's seen, it looks particularly impressive while reflecting Ferrari's unique melding of function and style. The optional power Daytona seats are heavily bolstered for support during spirited driving while carrying plenty of padding to provide comfort during everyday driving and they're looking as fresh as you could want, bracketed by door panels to each side, and a center console between them that reflect the same condition. The dash area, also in great form, is a conversation piece unto itself. Known as the optional Carbon Fiber Driving Zone with its carbon fiber inserts and dramatic but ergonomically well-laid out controls and gauges. are just awesome. The air conditioning system is prepared to cool down the cockpit with enthusiasm through no less than five vents in the dash, while an AM/FM/CD stereo is on standby to handle your audio needs. While the F430 is all about world class performance and aesthetics, the storage area up front is surprisingly roomy. Raise the rear hatch and you'll be transfixed by the sight of the 4.3 liter engine sitting inside. While its outstanding output - nearly 500 horsepower, enough to propel the F430 from 0-60 in well under four seconds - is its main calling card, its presentation in this setting has to be seen to be appreciated. The engine compartment is in showroom condition, allowing the powerplant's silver and red components to really stand out. The F430's low-profile, road hugging stance combines with the substantial downdraft Ferrari engineered in - as well as Ferrari's revolutionary E-Diff rear end, which varies the distribution of torque to the wheels based on steering angle and lateral acceleration - to produce world-class handling. 4-wheel carbon ceramic power disc brakes that feature sizable, heat-dissipating rotors bring the car to a stop from 60mph in just 114 feet - just a little over the length of a basketball court - as this performance icon creates excitement on its 19\" stock Ferrari wheels outfitted with brand new Michelin Pilot Sport 4S tires. Whether the barometer is world class performance or world class looks, this Ferrari F430 stands in very select company. Call today! Contact us now at 844-582-6139 for more details!

This 1986 Ferrari 328 GTS looks that good, and it's in great shape too - having benefited from unusually light usage over the years - and carries a stack of maintenance records in...\u00a0its glove box as proof that it's well-positioned to offer years of future driving excitement. The 328 cuts an immediately recognizable yet dramatic appearance. Its forerunner, the 308, was a huge success featured for years on television's \"Magnum PI,\" no doubt prompting millions of viewers to admire the man beyond the wheel and think to themselves, \"He's got some kind of life.\" Still clad in just the original shade of red you'd associate with this storied vehicle, you can see how this 328 represents a visual improvement over its predecessor, with its updated grille and more contoured bumpers painted to match the rest of the exterior. England's Motor Magazine put it best when they reviewed the 328 the year this one came out and said, \"It's as close to a work of art as a car can be.\" All that visual magic is intact, and in fact this is one of only two that came from the factory with a red painted spoiler and targa top which itself is a great feature - affording the pleasure of open air motoring with the shelter of its lightweight panels just a couple of steps away. After more than 30 years of life, everything remains well-aligned, with flip-up headlights that raise promptly into position to reveal very clear lenses and clean buckets inside. The tan leather interior looks unusually fresh for its age, reflecting the notion that this performer has lived a sheltered life when not put to use. The bucket seats still have a very firm shape and show no pronounced wear marks or cracking on their surfaces, and are matched by a center console in between them that's just as clean with its chrome shifter and black control switches. The door panels on both sides were replaced a while back and don't show much evidence of use at all, and the power windows sitting inside them operate smoothly. The dash area looks great - you'll find a thorough assortment of easily readable gauges in the cluster and an arched black dash pad on top that, in spite of its color's sensitivity to UV rays, remains supple looking and split-free. An AM/FM/CD player stands by to provide your tunes while on the road. Some of the most welcome improvements gifted to the 328 are found in its drivetrain. The 3.2 liter V8 under the hood features more displacement than those before it and provides in excess of 260 horsepower - enough to rocket this lightweight car forward very convincingly. Ferrari was out in front of the curve as far as performance engineering, so you'll find independent suspensions both fore and aft and a sturdy anti-roll bar sitting in place to keep things level during hard cornering. The 5-speed manual transmission shifts very easily, the power rack and pinion is impressively precise and, with power disc brakes at all four corners, this GTS comes to a stop very quickly. Its timing belt - so often an Achilles heel for many cars - was replaced a few years ago to provide plenty of worry-free motoring and the stainless Tubi exhaust provides the perfect note. A true Italian classic, it sits on a set of 16\" stock Ferrari wheels that have been refinished and wrapped with Michelin tires. This 1986 Ferrari 328 GTS represents the chance to put a classic example of Italian automotive design in your garage. Call today! Contact us now at 844-582-6139 for more details!

About Gas Motor Cars, Inc Founded in 2011 by lifelong automotive enthusiast and Atlanta native Tony Marzullo, Gas Motorcars, Inc. is a family-owned and operated car dealership with headquarters located in Marietta, Ga. After spending several years in retail sales with AM General and Hummer, Marzullo decided in 2000 to open Global Auto Solutions, a full-service automotive concierge. Global&rsquo;s mission was to help private individuals buy and sell vehicles. Acting as an independent broker allowed Marzullo to use his informed automotive knowledge in an objective fashion. Global never pressured a prospective buyer toward any specific product. Instead, Global&rsquo;s mission was to find the right fit for the customer. This principled set of values, still maintained today, results in customers purchasing only what they need. For over 12 years, Global Auto Solutions, and now Gas Motorcars, Inc., transformed the car purchase and sale into the business of helping people save time and save money. Gas Motorcars&rsquo; clients consist of professional athletes, business owners, executives of Fortune 500 companies, doctors, attorneys, accountants, school teachers, housewives, and anyone who recognizes that their time is valuable and that the task of finding the proper vehicle is one that is best delegated to Gas Motorcars. Gas Motorcars, Inc. is a fully licensed and bonded car dealer in the state of Georgia. Gas Motorcars goal is to sell vehicles of only the highest quality. We do not sell cars with mystery stories. We do not charge extra fees. We do not waste our clients&rsquo; time. We provide a comfortable experience, free of hassle, with an honest approach to buying and selling cars. We know what we sell: the majority of the vehicles listed for sale are on consignment from existing clients, friends, and family.

The F355 was the evolution of the Ferrari 348. Design emphasis for the F355 was placed on significantly improved performance, as well as drivability across a wider range of speeds and in different environments such as low-speed city traffic. The major difference between the V8 engine in the 348 and F355 is the introduction of a 5-valve cylinder head. This new head design allowed for better intake permeability and resulted in an engine that was considerably more powerful, producing 375 HP and 268 ft-lbs of Torque. Aerodynamic designs for the car included over 1,300 hours of wind tunnel analysis. The car incorporates a nolder profile on the upper portion of the tail, and a fairing on the underbody that generates downforce when the car is at speed. Coupled with the engine improvements, this allowed the F355 to reach 60 MPH in a mere 4.5 Seconds with a quarter mile coming in 12.9 Seconds and a top speed of 183 MPH. An additional 1,800 hours of wind tunnel testing was conducted on the Spyder and F355 was the first Ferrari in history to have a semi-automatic convertible top. This unique example is finished in extremely rare Verde Silverstone and is a true head turner. With under 27K miles registered, she is very snappy and drives incredibly well.

The Ferrari 360 Modena, named after the birth place of Enzo Ferrari was introduced in 1999 and replaced the F355. It was the first production Ferrari to feature an all Aluminum space-frame which was 40% stiffer and 28% lighter than the steel one used in the F355.Along with a lightweight frame the new Pininfarina body styling deviated from traditions of the previous decade's sharp angles and flip-up headlights. The new V8 engine, utilizes a 3.6 liter capacity, flat plane crankshaft, titanium connecting rods and generates 395HP. Despite what on paper, looked like modest gains, in reality, the power-to-weight ratio was significantly improved on over the F355, due to the combination of both reduction in weight and more power. According to Ferrari weight was reduced by 60kg and the 0 to 60 mph acceleration time improved to 4.5 seconds. This Black Beauty has been meticulously cared for and has two large binders documenting all of the service records, original manuals, factory car cover, and factory tool kit. With a clean Carfax and only 24,000 Miles, she is an excellent value and won't disappoint. Tasteful mods include a clear bra to the top of the roof, rock guards by the wheel wells and a TUBI exhaust that creates an unbelievable sound only found on Ferraris.

The power comes from the original 3 liter V8 with Webber carbs and drives out smooth and it has all the brash charm any Italian Sports car would want. That power is funneled through a correct 5 speed gear box. This an original solid and unrestored car. Did I already say that?. The paint is in good shape with the expected patina of a...\u00a039 year old car. There are no chips or dings but there is some crazing in the finish. The interior is still like new and immaculate. It comes with lots of service records original manuals and tool kit not to mention copies of titles from the previous owners. The belts were changed at just under 25k miles according to one previous owner. If you have room in the barn for a Prancing Horse that will make its new owner proud and bring lots of smiles as it slips along the streets of its new home town don't be bashful.

About Marino Performance Motors Greg Marino\u2019s enthusiasm for automobiles started at an early age with the now classic Ford Mustangs. Driven by an intense interest of the cars he wanted to know them inside out, lifting engines and transmissions, restoring chassis, savoring the process of fine tuning and making adjustments to get optimum performance. Beginning in his teens working for years with one of the top dealerships in New England, Greg decided to venture off on his own. With a $10,000 loan on a small twenty car lot, he founded Auto-torium and over a span of 20 years built his business into one of New Hampshire\u2019s largest and most successful dealerships. During this time he has continued his infatuation for exotic imports and Mustang Shelbys buying and selling within his private collection, and also by racing Porsches. Marino Performance Motors was sparked by Greg\u2019s passion for finding the elite of performance, classic muscle cars and exotics at the best price. His mission is to provide you with the vehicle you\u2019ve been searching for, not only to enjoy, but as an investment well below new model pricing eliminating the high financial losses attributed to purchasing new. For him these automobiles are an integration of artistic design and the ultimate in performance and technology. He looks forward to collaborating with clients who share this deep appreciation.

This Ferrari 458 Spider signals the arrival of a brand new generation of V8-engined Ferrari convertibles. Every Ferrari is the result of an uncompromising design approach that integrates styling and aerodynamic requirements. The Pininfarina design features compact, aerodynamic lines, underscoring the concepts of performance-oriented efficiency that inspired the project. The nose features a single opening for the front grille and side air intakes, with aerodynamic sections and profiles designed to direct air to the coolant radiators and the new flat underbody. The nose also sports small aeroelastic winglets which generate downforce and, as speed rises, deform to reduce the section of the radiator intake and cut drag. The result is a highly innovative design, characterized by cutting-edge technologies perfected for use on a road-going car. Two of these innovations for production cars: the electronic differential (E-Diff) initially developed by Ferrari for its F1 single-seaters and designed to make the most of the engines torque to optimize traction, and the handily placed steering wheel-mounted rotary switch (better known to the Formula 1 drivers as the manettino) which directly controls the integrated systems governing vehicle dynamics. On the track, the E-Diff guarantees maximum grip out of bends, eliminating wheel spin. On the road it is a formidable technological refinement that improves roadholding. This 2013 Ferrari 458 Spider is equipped with Ferraris all-new 274.5 cubic inch V8 motor which produces approximately 560hp and goes 0-60Mph in approximately less than 4 seconds! It is also capable of speeds over approxmately 196Mph! The Ferrari 458s engines improvement in terms of performance, weight and reduction of overall dimensions is the result of applying Ferraris wealth of F1 experience to this fine sportscar. The F1 transmission in this beautiful exotic is state of the art, introducing a number of important modifications. Thanks to inputs from the engineers on the Gestione Sportiva racing side, the F1 Dual-Clutch gearbox management incorporates a new control strategy which further perfects gearchange speed and smoothness under hard use. The standard transmission is a Getrag dual-clutch 7-speed transmission, similar to the Ferrari California. There is no traditional manual option, making this the fourth road-car after the Enzo, Challenge Stradale and 430 Scuderia not to be offered with Ferrari's classic gated manual. Its the first mainstream model to not be offered with a manual transmission. The interior is noticeably bigger than its predecessor and has a better overall feel. This 2013 Ferrari 458 Spider is one of the finest examples of its kind! Please call our experienced sales staff to find out more on this absolutely stunning 458 Spider.

And the cresting 398 lb-ft of torque at 6000 rpm can throw you back into your seat. One has only to hear the 458 Spider let loose the guttural F1-style scream to fully understand why one automobile magazine said of the 458 Spider that it \"is perhaps the closest man has come to creating an animal.\" Indeed! The 458 Spider is the world's first retractable hardtop (RHT) convertible mid-engine supercar. The 458 Spider goes from coupe to convertible is just 14 seconds, and it is equipped with a retracting rear wind stop window to calm the winds within the cabin. On a practical side, the cargo bench behind the seats accommodates one full-size golf bag or two carry-on bags. Driving the 2012 Ferrari 458 Spider was so \"amazing\" that it brought British race car driver Vicki Butler-Henderson to tears! She says, \"it's hard to imagine a car that makes you feel more alive than this! The 458 Spider is OUT OF THIS WORLD!\" This particular 2012 Ferrari 458 Spider lived its life in Marin County not far from Ferrari of San Francisco. The previous owner is a distinguished member of the Ferrari of San Francisco famiglia and a true connoisseur of blue Ferraris; he has had many blue Ferraris grace his stable over the years. This Blu Tour de France 458 Spider is a beauty to behold, but take her out into the sunlight and she transforms from merely beautiful to breathtaking. This automobile was given meticulous care and was carefully driven only short distances making this 2012 458 Spider one of the lowest mileage 458 Spiders on the market today. Also, this 458 Spider represents an excellent value as one of the lowest priced 2012 Ferrari 458 Spiders around! Ferrari of San Francisco is one of the top-rated franchise dealers in North America ranked by Ferrari S.p.A. and Dealer Rater! As a leader in Ferrari's most prominent market, there are many reasons why many clients are proud to call themselves members of the Ferrari of San Francisco famiglia. Call (415) 380-9700 today to speak with one of our experienced sales consultants.

Options Include: FACTORY AIR CONDITIONINGPOWER WINDOWS14\u201d CAMPAGNOLO WHEELSBLAUPUNKT AM/FM STEREO The 308 is considered by many to be one of Ferrari\u2019s greatest manufacturing and styling triumphs. The original 308 GTB released in 1975 was the first production Ferrari to be produced with a fiberglass body, excluding the front bonnet which was aluminium. These models are also sometimes referred to as the GRP (glass reinforced plastic) or Vetroresina (Italian for fiberglass) cars. The first production 308 GTB was unveiled at the Paris Salon in October 1975 and was an instant hit with the motoring press and general public. Fans of the Dino 246 GT were particularly pleased to see some of the design elements of the old car carried across, such as the scalloper air intakes on the side panels, twin tail lights and recessed curved rear window. The car also received the \u201cwedge\u201d treatment which was fashionable at the time, but unlike some of its contemporaries it was applied in restraint. The 1976 Ferrari 308GTB Vetroresina featured here is finished in gorgeous Rosso Chiaro Red with an impeccably kept tan leather interior. This original California car is among one of the most original, lower mile examples to come on the market in years; its meticulous maintenance has been documented with service records going back to the early 80s by marquee specialists. The original owner\u2019s manual, jack, tool kit, seat covers also accompany this motorcar. We are proud to offer this incredible 308GTB Vetroresina to the most demanding collector or investor who wants the best. Classic cars have proven to be among the most resilient and rewarding investments in recent years with the Historic Automobile Group Index jumping 39% in 2013, 16% in 2014 and 17% in 2015 while posting gains of 467% over the last 10 years.

Financing Finance rates as low as 5.9%. We know that classic car financing can pose a unique challenge. Although a vintage or exotic car can be an excellent investment, some financial institutions attempt to apply standard \u201cused car\u201d rules for financing a classic car, which in many cases can make loan approval difficult. We work closely with many banking institutions that understand and recognize the collector value of classic cars and view them as an investment, which allows us to help you get the financing you need so that you can have the car you have dreamed of. Terms available up to 144 Months If you have any questions, feel free to contact us, (314)291-7000 or credit@schmitt.com * Rates vary depending on year of car, length of term and credit score. --> Daniel Schmitt & Co. is a proud sponsor of M.A.D.D.

The bottom line is: nobody sells or has one just like this anywhere in the world. This car is a prime example of the works of art in automotive history. There are very few things out there that are as pleasing to the eyes as this Ferrari. This car is European specifications, it was manufactured during the summer of 2002. It was purchased from Denzel Ferrari of Austria, the authorized Ferrari dealer at the time. The car will come with all original factory accessories, books and documentation. This Modena Spider has never been registered, and it is in new condition. EU taxes (VAT, etc.) has been paid on it. Of course, it would make a lot of sense to have this car in Europe, but it can be a priced possession anywhere. It was only driven at two local Ferrari shows at the request of the Ferrari dealership. This car has always been stored in temperature controlled garage in Budapest, Hungary and that's the location where it can be picked up by the buyer. After full payment I can assist in shipping or in continued storage.Any questions: please contact me on +1 713 408-3854 or via eBay.Note: I will be in Budapest for the next 2 weeks - I can show you this car personally.",

It is fitted with a desirable 6-speed manual transmission and is finished in Tour De France Blue with a tan leather interior. While exact ownership history is not known we do know that the car was delivered new by Ferrari Maserati of Ft Lauderdale. It later passed through 2 more owners in TX and IL before staying with it\u2019s most recent owner...\u00a0since 2010. During that ownership it appears a major belt service was carried out in 2012 and since minor services have been completed along the way. While the car runs and drives well, by time, it is recommended by Ferrari that the car receive another major service in the near future. This car would best be described as a driver quality example. While it remains a striking piece of Italian machinery with fairly low miles, it has numerous small blemishes and imperfections that could be corrected should the new owner desire.EXTERIORBody & PaintThe Tour De France blue paint is absolutely stunning in person and is fairly smooth and consistent throughout. The finish of the paint, however, shows many signs of usage. The front of the car has numerous small stone chips from every day driving. There is some scuffing present on the front bumper and the front lip is a bit scraped up and has some stone chips in it. The rear bumper is in similar condition with some chipping and minor scuffing. Both rocker panels have minor stone peppering on them as well. The mirrors have some minor peppering from stones. There is also some chipping on the edges of the doors, more than likely from careless opening incidents. The door handle areas are slightly scratched up from normal usage and black painted cowl at the bottom of the windshield has some stone chips and flaking paint. Body panel gaps are respectable and straight with possibly a bit of ill fitment in places such as the rear bumper. The body panels themselves are smooth and straight, showing no major dents or dings.Glass & TrimThe glass appears to be all the correct type with proper Ferrari Sigla stampings on each of the panes. The windshield has some very minor pitting from stones but the rest of the glass remains clean and clear. The headlights, like the rest of the front end, show signs of usage with pitting, small scratches and a minor bit of haze. The front fog lights and taillights, however, are all clean and clear. Many of the painted trim surfaces are showing their age and the paint is chipped, faded and wearing, especially around the passenger window. The rubber trim around the passenger headlight has become loose towards the front edge and the fitment is off however the driver side remains supple and tight.WheelsThe wheels were more than likely refinished at some point as the painted surfaced are smooth and consistent with no curbing or rubbing, not entirely consistent with the clear usage present on the rest of the car. The center caps are brand new, having been replaced with OEM pieces. The mounting hardware is in good condition with no oxidation or damage present. Ferrari brand valve stem caps are in place.Notable FlawsThe exterior surfaces of the car show significant signs of usage. The front has many small stone chips and there is fading and cracked paint on trim surfaces. INTERIORSeats & SurfacesThe tan leather interior compliments the exterior color superbly. The overall condition mimics the exterior with signs of wear and usage present throughout. The driver\u2019s side door card is in good shape but there is some discoloration where one\u2019s elbow would rub on the door card. Both seats show a bit of wear around the bolsters and edges with minor sagging and creasing. The driver seat stitching has come undone near the upper portion and padding is visible poking through. The rear parcel shelf is in good shape with clean and tight leather and only minor signs of age in the form of a bit of creasing in spots. The buckle straps appear to have seen very minimal usage as they are in great condition. The carpets in the cabin are worn in high traffic areas with some staining present throughout. The steering wheel has some minor imperfections from normal usage. The dash and accent leather are finished in blue compliment the exterior of the car. The dash is relatively clean and smooth with only some minor pulling occurring around the top instrument cluster. The headliner is finished in quilted patterned leather similar to the rear parcel shelf and is tight and clean. There is a set of aftermarket speakers installed near the door jams, finished in complimenting tan leather with the rest of the interior which could be kept or removed easily at the discretion of the new owner. Some of the plastic surfaces display fading and light peeling (such as the air vents) but overall the interior is essentially free from the dreaded \u201cstick bits\u201d that plague Ferraris of this era.Functionality & AccessoriesAll switches and gauges appear to function as they should, however, some of the surfaces do show signs of wear and usage. The air vents, in particular, have some fading and flaking of the surfaces around their edges. The power seats function as they should and the windows power up and down with ease.Notable FlawsThe driver\u2019s side seat has some stitching that has separated towards the top edge. The carpets are faded and have some staining present. Some of the interior plastic surfaces have flaking paint, fading, and signs of usage. ENGINE BAY, TRUNK, UNDERSIDEEngine BayThe engine bay appears like much of the rest of the car with signs of usage but in relatively good condition. The entirety of the engine bay could stand to receive a good detail which would help it to clean up nicely. Painted surfaces are relatively smooth and consistent. Black plastic surfaces are in good condition with some minor fading present in some spots. the metal intake and valve covers have a slight yellow hue to them, likely from normal usage, dirt and heat. All rubber hoses and wires appear in good condition with no cracking or worn components present upon inspection. The fire pad under the hood is in good condition with no major wear or discoloration.TrunkThere is an amp in the trunk to power the aftermarket speakers located in the cabin as well as a 6-disc cd changer, both properly mounted. The carpeting in the trunk is clean and free of major wear or staining.UndersideThe underside of the car shows signs of usage with the black plastics having some scuffs and scrapes. Wheel wells are a little dirty but in overall good order. There are no signs of any issues such as leaks etc.Notable FlawsOther than an aftermarket amp being mounted in the trunk there are no notable issues.MECHANICALSEngineThe engine fires right to life with a turn of the key and settles into a smooth idle. It makes good power with no flat spots or stumbling to speak of. It revs freely and sounds excellent even through the stock exhaust.TransmissionThe clutch take-up and engagement feel great. The shifter moves through its gated slots with no issues and the transmission engages all gears with no issue. It holds good powers and revs freely.Brakes & SuspensionThe brake pedal feels properly firm and reassuring. The cars comes to a smooth and controlled stop with no chatter or noises to note. The suspension feels compliant and responsive and there is no odd noises or excessive body roll to speak of.TiresThe tires are BF-Goodrich g-force T/A on all four corners. They are relatively new and have plenty of treadle left in them with no signs of aging. Contact us now at 877-582-7218 for more details!

The winner of this auction will have the opportunity to own this beautiful 1966 Ferrari 330GT 2+2 Series 1. The paint is in excellent condition and it is apparent that this car was garaged and meticulously-maintained. The interior is virtually flawless and is equipped with all the right options showing 29,532 miles. You can't go wrong with this fabulous vehicle! This 330GT 2+2 Series 1 is one of only 625 examples, matching numbers engine, Sympathetic restoration completed in 2015.300php, 3,967 cc SOHC V12 engine with three weber carburetors, 5-speed manual transmission, independent front suspension with unequal length A-arms and coil springs, live rear axle with semi-elliptical leaf springs and parallel trailing arms and 4 wheel disc brakes.Introduced at the Brussels motor show of January 1964, Ferrari's 330 GT 2+2 was the replacement for the outgoing 250 GT 2+2, and it notably elevated the prior four-seat platform with advanced mechanical elements and improved aesthetics. Most importantly, the one model received a larger and more powerful version of the Colombo short block engine that displaced 4.0 liters and was good for 300 HP. Factory driver Mike Parkes was a key contributor to the 330's development, even claiming credit for the eye-catching dual headlamp front fascia. Single headlamps were adopted with the succeeding second series cars that appeared in min 1965 leaving just 625 examples that were built with the double lamp design. Chassis number 7515 claims an unusual identity as one of very few transition cars that share features of the first and second series 330GT models. As one of the final series 1 examples built, this car is clothed in Pininfarina's handsome dual headlight body style, complete with knock-off borrani whire wheels. Mechanically, the 330 is equipped with some more developed features from the second series cars, including suspended pedals rather than a floor mounted pedal box and a 5 speed gearbox rather than a 4 speed with overdrive. this latter component endows chassis number 7515 with particularly long legs for extended high-speed cruising, a highly desirable attribute in a true GT car. According to a history by marque historian Marcel Massini, this 330 2+2 was completed at the actory in July 1965 (Equipped with air conditioning) and delivered new to Luigi Chinetti Motors. By 1973, the car was owned by Ewing Hunter, a Co-owner of FAF motorcars in Tucker, Georgia, the well-known dealership that was one of the collectible Ferrari Hobby's earliest American institutions. Passing to a chain o Illinois based caretakers in the early 1980's this 330 was owned by collector John Weinberger in 1987, by which time it had been repainted in Rosso. in 1992, while displaying just 25k original miles, the Ferrari was offered by esteemed collector Steve Levy of Riverwoods, Illinois.The minimally driven 330 GT 2+2 was treated to a sympathetic restoration that provided a clutch overhaul, new motor mounts, and master cylinder, rebuilt carburetors, new belts and hoses, and a partial rebuild of the engine with new piston rings, rod bearings, and valve guides. The paint and interior continue to present quite well, having been restored under a recent prior caretaker.Currently displaying approximately 29,523 miles which are believed to be original, chassis number 7515 is a beautifully restored example of the handsome first series 330GT. it would strongly complememt any collection of touring sports cars and also provides a good entry to the hobby as a model that is almost certain to appreciate in coming years.

The winner of this auction will have the opportunity to own this beautiful 1999 Ferrari 355 Fiorano Spider. The paint is in excellent condition and it is apparent that this car was garaged and meticulously-maintained. The interior is virtually flawless and is equipped with all the right options with only 16,545 miles. You can't go wrong with this fabulous vehicle! The ultimate expression of the revolutionary F355, this is Serial No. 60 of 100 Ferrari F355 limited-edition Serie Fiorano Spiders built in 1999. Ferrari&rsquo;s stature as the maker of the world&rsquo;s most coveted sports cars was under serious challenge in the early 1990s, but the company reversed its fortunes in dramatic fashion with the F355 unveiled in the spring of 1994. This all-new mid-engined design bore more than a passing resemblance to its 348 predecessor, but the similarities were only skin deep; beneath the surface was an all-new and stunning performer that set a new standard for Ferrari performance. The F355&rsquo;s longitudinally mounted 3.5L V-8 engine was a completely new design employing highly sophisticated 5-valve cylinder heads, titanium connecting rods and highly tuned intake and exhaust systems to aid in reaching the F355&rsquo;s outlandish 8,500 RPM redline and 375 HP output. The final rendition of the F355 was the 1999 Serie Fiorano, limited to only 100 examples. This very exclusive Ferrari drew heavily from the famed Competizione versions of 1995, using that model&rsquo;s suspension that included firmer calibrations in the springs and electronically controlled shock absorbers, a larger-diameter sway bar, cross-drilled brake rotors and painted calipers with racing brake pads, Challenge rear grilles and Scuderia Ferrari cloisonn\u00e9 fender shields. Exclusive interior features included carbon-fiber shifter paddles and trim pieces, an Alcantara-covered steering wheel and a silver dash plaque declaring this example as No. 60 in Serie Fiorano production. This Serie Fiorano No. 60 is traditionally finished in Nero with a Burgandy interior. It is equipped with Ferrari&rsquo;s fabulous paddle-shifted F1 automatic transmission and a folder full of the service history, Original books, and Ferrari car cover accompanies this rare 355 Fiorano Spider.

        "Description": "1985 Ferrari 308 GTS Quattrovalvole Exceptional Ferrari 308 GTSi Quattrovalve in rare Fly Yellow over Crema Leather! From the previous owner of 19 years, it has been beautiful kept and maintained! Only 1,500 miles on last cam belt service completed in 2015, and absolutely ready to enjoy! Sweet investment for anyone looking for a final year 308 Targa Roof Ferrari! The Pininfarina-designed Ferrari 308 was a brilliantly modeled style that combined details of earlier successes to create an iconic shape easily recognizable buy all car enthusiasts today. With a stellar wedge shape, tube chassis, transversely-mounted 2927cc V8 with dual overhead camshafts, 5-speed fully synchromesh gate-shifted transaxle, 4-wheel independent suspension, 4-wheel ventilated disc brakes, front & rear anti-sway bars, rack & pinion steering, and limited slip differential, Ferrari put a potent machine on the streets that was quite sexy, but one that would endure an 11-year production run through 1985! Although, none equal to the next, improvements year-to-year would make the latter production units highly desirable. The carburetors were abandoned in 1980 in lieu of the favored Bosch K-Jetronic Fuel Injection system. By 1982, the valve train gained Quattrovalvole status to support 32-valve technology (4-valves per cylinder) to improve much needed horsepower & torque performance. Offered in both Berlinetta (GTB) and Spyder(GTS) designs, the final year production 1985 Ferrari 308 Quattrovalve is one of the strongest investments in the Ferrari collector market today! Make no mistake about the opportunity such an icon; the visual appearance, ease of maintenance, and overall driving pleasure! We are very pleased to offer this 1985 Ferrari 308 GTSi finished in very rare, factory code correct FER-102- Fly Yellow with Crema Beige Leather interior accented with black piping! Not only unique by color, this particular example was hand-picked by the General Motors Engineering Center/GM Corporation based in Warren, MI to be studied under the Chevrolet/Pontiac/Canada Group who purchased it from the Sports Car Exchange, Inc. in Dearborn, Michigan on April 23rd, 1985 with 1,080 miles already registered on the odometer. It would stay in their possession until February 1992 and sold officially to its first registered owner with approximately 26,000 miles. It would travel to the Minneapolis, Minnesota region with just owners since. The second of these lucky owners acquiring this Ferrari in August 1999 and brilliantly maintaining it ever since! Features include original Blaupunkt AM/FM/Cassette radio, air conditioning, Ferrari fender shields, 5-spoke light alloy wheels measuring 16\u201dx7\u201d up front and 16\u201dx8\u201d at the rear, BF Goodrich radial tires, leather wrapped Momo steering wheel, power windows, rear defrost, and more! Today, this stunning example shows only 43,870 miles on the odometer. All new front & rear suspension control arm bushings were fitted in June 2002 at 34,534 miles along with new engine rear main seal, clutch o-ring seal kit, and 4-wheel alignment by Donnybrooke Auto Service. It remains accident free, in superb condition with one exterior repaint in 2004 by Precision Restoration & Paint, and otherwise all original. A new water pump was fitted in May 2007 by Donnybrooke Auto Service at 37,752 miles. The former owner of 19 years was passionate about proper cam belt and tensioner major services, completing them accordingly in 2003, 2009, and most recently in June 2015 at 42,300 miles by Morrie\u2019s Maserati based in Minneapolis, MN. These services include cam cover gaskets, cam seals, all engine & differential fluids, valve adjustments, valve cover gaskets, distributor cap & support gaskets. Front brake pads where installed in July 2009, while new rear pads where just installed this month in 2018. The St. Louis Car Museum also serviced the air conditioning system and retrofitted it to R134a refrigerant, replaced the engine air filter, engine oil & filter, rear axle dust boots, added a battery charger for times of storage, and detailed the car throughout! Subtle enhancements include Euro-spec style aluminum foot pedals, polished aluminum shift knob, clear/amber front turn signal lenses, and custom rear valance panel surrounding the exhaust just wonderfully! This car will be sold with a clean CarFax report, original warranty booklet, owner\u2019s manual, original pedal pads, original shift knob, Marelli mirror insert tabs, extra turn signal housings, turn signal lenses, previous cam belts for new owner inspection, spark plug extenders, and front license plate bracket. This presents a wonderful chance to own an exceptionally well maintained 308 GTSi in a striking color you will find nowhere else on the market! We invite inspections and offers.
