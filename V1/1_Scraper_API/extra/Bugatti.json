VIN number MVIN 352258IND (the ebay format did not let me enter the number in required field since it is kit built). Made with a Volkswagen engine and chassis. Fiberglass body which is good all around, no cracks, damage or repairs. Has recently had a mechanic go over engine and replace the carburetor, some wiring, a window, a ring gear. 4 speed manual transmission. Sharp interior with black seats, nice dash. Sounds and runs nicely. Only a crack to one rear tail lite. Odometer reading is under 2000 miles but not sure how accurate. Not driven much. Can be seen in South Bend, Indiana.",
